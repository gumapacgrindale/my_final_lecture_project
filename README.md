Each folder contains:
- A `.java` source file for the activity.
- A `README.md` file that provides a comprehensive explanation of the code: what it does, what Java concepts are used, and how it works in practice.

📌 **For full explanations, please refer to the individual `README.md` files inside each folder.**

## ▶️ How to Run the Activities

Each program can be compiled and run using **Java JDK** on your terminal or any Java IDE like **Eclipse**, **NetBeans**, or **IntelliJ**.

### 📦 For Console-based Programs (Lab 1-3, Midterm, Project):
1. Open your terminal or IDE.
2. Navigate to the folder (e.g., `cd lab1`)
3. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac LabActivity1EmployeeInformationSystem.java
   ```

4. Run the program:
  ```bash
  javac LabActivity1EmployeeInformationSystem.java
  ```

### 🖼️ For GUI-based Programs (Lab 4-6, Calculator):

1. Follow the same steps as above.
2. Make sure your screen allows pop-up windows (GUI will launch).

☑️ No external libraries required. All programs run using Java SE (Standard Edition).

## 🙋‍♂️ About This Repository
This compilation reflects my learning progress throughout the semester in **Computer Programming 2 using Java**. It shows:
* My ability to work with both console-based and graphical user interface applications
* How I structure programs using methods, validation, arrays, loops, and OOP principles
* How I document and organize code professionally using Markdown

## 📢 PS: A Note from the Novice Developer (ME)
✨ I used `**ChatGPT by OpenAI**` to help me describe, document, and organize each activity in the best possible format. All code was written by me, and ChatGPT helped ensure that the explanations are well-structured, professional, and easy to understand for readers and evaluators.
