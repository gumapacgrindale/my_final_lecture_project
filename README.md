## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Activities

Each program can be compiled and run using **Java JDK** on your terminal or any Java IDE like **Eclipse**, **NetBeans**, or **IntelliJ**.

### üì¶ For Console-based Programs (Lab 1-3, Midterm, Project):
1. Open your terminal or IDE.
2. Navigate to the folder (e.g., `cd lab1`)
3. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac LabActivity1EmployeeInformationSystem.java

4. Run the program:
  ```bash
  javac LabActivity1EmployeeInformationSystem.java
  ```

### üñºÔ∏è For GUI-based Programs (Lab 4-6, Calculator):

1. Follow the same steps as above.
2. Make sure your screen allows pop-up windows (GUI will launch).

* ‚òëÔ∏è No external libraries required. All programs run using Java SE (Standard Edition).
