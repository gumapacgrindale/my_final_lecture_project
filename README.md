- Dynamic GUI Output: Displays results in a non-editable text area after calculations

### ‚öôÔ∏è Process:

1. GUI form collects:
	- First name, last name, age, hours worked, hourly rate

2. Validates:
- All fields are filled
- Age is a valid integer
- Hours and rate are valid numbers

3. Computes salary: `hours * rate`

4. Displays:
- Full name, age, and daily salary in formatted PHP output

### üß™ Sample Output (GUI):

```
Full Name: Juan Dela Cruz
Age: 21 years old
Daily Salary: PHP 640.00
