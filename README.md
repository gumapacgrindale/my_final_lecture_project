## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Activities

Each program can be compiled and run using **Java JDK** on your terminal or any Java IDE like **Eclipse**, **NetBeans**, or **IntelliJ**.

### üì¶ For Console-based Programs (Lab 1-3, Midterm, Project):
1. Open your terminal or IDE.

2. Navigate to the folder (e.g., `cd lab1`)

3. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac LabActivity1EmployeeInformationSystem.java
   ```

4. Run the program:
  ```bash
  javac LabActivity1EmployeeInformationSystem.java
  ```

### üñºÔ∏è For GUI-based Programs (Lab 4-6, Calculator):

1. Follow the same steps as above.

2. Make sure your screen allows pop-up windows (GUI will launch).

‚òëÔ∏è No external libraries required. All programs run using Java SE (Standard Edition).

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About This Repository
This compilation reflects my learning progress throughout the second semester in **Computer Programming 2 using Java**. It shows:
* My ability to work with both console-based and graphical user interface applications
* How I structure programs using methods, validation, arrays, loops, and OOP principles
* How I document and organize code professionally using Markdown

## üì¢ PS: A Note from the Novice Developer (ME)
‚ú® I used `**ChatGPT by OpenAI**` to help me describe, document, and organize each activity in the best possible format. All code was written by me, and ChatGPT helped ensure that the explanations are well-structured, professional, and easy to understand for readers and evaluators.

# Compacted Description
### üßæ Lab Activity 1 Summary
This Java console application simulates a **basic employee information system**. It prompts the user to input their personal details and work hours, then calculates their **daily salary**.

### üîë Key Concepts:
- `Scanner` for user input
- Data types: `String`, `int`, `double`
- Basic arithmetic and salary computation
- `System.out.print` and `System.out.printf` for formatted output

### ‚öôÔ∏è Process:

1. User inputs: name, age, hours worked, hourly wage

2. Program computes: `dailyWage = hoursWorked * hourlyWage`

3. Output: Full name, age, and daily salary in PHP (formatted)

### üß™ Sample Output:
Displays formatted employee details and computed salary.

### üîß Real-World Use:
Useful for small payroll calculations, academic practice, or as a basic payroll component in larger systems.
#
### üßæ Lab Activity 2 Summary
This program builds upon Lab 1 by adding **more detailed salary computations** and an estimate of **years left until retirement**. It calculates daily, weekly, monthly, gross yearly, and net yearly wages.

üîë Key Concepts:
- Reuse of inputs: name, age, hours worked, hourly rate
- Math functions: `Math.abs()` and `Math.round()`
- Extended calculations (weekly √ó 5, monthly √ó 4, yearly √ó 12)
- Net salary computation with tax and fixed deduction

‚öôÔ∏è Process:

1. User inputs: name, age, hours worked, hourly wage

2. Program calculates:

3. Years to retirement (65 - age)

4. Rounded daily salary

5. Weekly, monthly, and gross yearly salary

5. Net yearly salary: deducts 32% tax and PHP 1500 in benefits

6. Outputs all results in formatted PHP currency

üß™ Sample Output:
Displays full name (in uppercase), age, years to retirement, and a breakdown of all salary types.

üîß Real-World Use:
Ideal for simulations of basic payroll systems that estimate yearly earnings and handle tax deductions.
#
### üßæ Lab Activity 3 Summary
This program enhances the Employee Information System by introducing **input validation** and **role-based categorization** using **conditional statements** like `if-else` and `switch`.

üîë Key Concepts:
- Input validation using if-else (e.g., age limits and hours worked restrictions)
- `return` used to exit the program early if invalid input is detected
- `switch` statement to map numeric role codes (1-4) to role names
- Extended salary calculations reused from previous labs

Tax logic with `if-else` based on income threshold

‚öôÔ∏è Process:

1. User inputs: name, age, hours worked, hourly wage, and role code

2. Validates:
	- Age must be between 18 and 64
	- Hours worked must be between 1 and 24

3. Maps role code to position (e.g., 1 = Manager, 2 = Supervisor, etc.)

4. Calculates:
	- Daily, weekly, monthly, gross, and net yearly salary
	- Applies 32% tax if gross income > ‚Ç±250,000

5. Displays all info with formatted output

üß™ Sample Output:
Shows full name, position, age, years to retirement, and a detailed salary breakdown.

üîß Real-World Use:
Simulates HR systems where inputs are validated and roles influence employment records. Introduces logic structure for filtering and controlling program flow.
#
###üßæ Lab Activity 4 Summary
This lab upgrades the previous employee system into a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Java **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**. It allows users to input employee data via text fields and shows results in a text area.

üîë Key Concepts:
Java AWT GUI: Uses components like `Frame`, `Panel`, `Label`, `TextField`, `TextArea`, and `Button`

Event Handling: `ActionListener` detects when the user clicks "Submit" and triggers computations

Input validation: Ensures all form fields are filled and checks for correct data types (e.g., `Integer.parseInt()` and `Double.parseDouble()`)

Dynamic GUI Output: Displays results in a non-editable text area after calculations

‚öôÔ∏è Process:

1. GUI form collects:
	- First name, last name, age, hours worked, hourly rate

2. Validates:
- All fields are filled
- Age is a valid integer
- Hours and rate are valid numbers

3. Computes salary: `hours * rate`

4. Displays:
- Full name, age, and daily salary in formatted PHP output

üß™ Sample Output (GUI):
	yaml
	```
	Copy
	Edit
	Full Name: Juan Dela Cruz
	Age: 21 years old
	Daily Salary: PHP 640.00
	```
üîß Real-World Use:
Introduces form-based interfaces found in real business software. Demonstrates how GUI input/output works, foundational for inventory apps, POS systems, or HR tools.
#
###üßæ Lab Activity 5 Summary
This activity demonstrates the creation of an interactive Quiz Application using Java AWT, where users answer multiple-choice questions through a GUI interface.

üîë Key Concepts:
- GUI Components: Uses `Frame`, `Label`, `Checkbox`, `CheckboxGroup`, and `Button` to build an interactive quiz layout
- Event Handling: `ActionListener` processes user selections and manages navigation between questions
- Array Usage:
	- Stores questions, choices, and correct answers in arrays
	- Tracks current question index and score using static variables
- Dynamic UI Update:
	- Each time the user clicks "Next", the next question and choices are loaded dynamically
- Result Summary: Displays a final score after all questions are answered

‚öôÔ∏è Process:

1. App loads and shows the **first question** with four multiple-choice answers

2. User selects an option and clicks **Next**

3. System checks if the answer is correct and updates the score

4. Moves to the next question or shows the final result after the last question

üß™ Sample Output (Final Result):
csharp
```
Quiz Completed! Your Score: 2 out of 3
```
üîß Real-World Use:
Represents the logic used in e-learning systems, review centers, and online assessments. Combines user interaction with logical flow control, input validation, and result computation in a GUI environment.
